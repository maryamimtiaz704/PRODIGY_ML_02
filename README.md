# Task-02: Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This repository contains **Task-02** for the **PRODIGY Machine Learning Track**.  
The objective of this task is to **group retail store customers into different segments**
based on their **purchase behavior** using **K-Means clustering**.

---

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle – Customer Segmentation Tutorial in Python  
- **File used:** `/content/sample_data/Mall_Customers.csv`

---

## Features Used
The following features were used to perform customer segmentation:
- **Annual Income**
- **Spending Score**

---

## Algorithm
- **K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)**

---

## Methodology
1. Imported required Python libraries  
2. Loaded the customer dataset  
3. Selected relevant features for clustering  
4. Applied the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters  
5. Trained the K-Means model  
6. Visualized customer clusters and centroids  

---

## Results
- Customers were successfully grouped into multiple clusters
- Each cluster represents a distinct customer segment based on income and spending behavior

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## Notes
- This project demonstrates the use of **unsupervised learning**
- The notebook and dataset used for this task are included in this repository
